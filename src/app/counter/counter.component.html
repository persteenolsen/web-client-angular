<h3>Description</h3>

A simple demo about state management by RxJS
<br /> <br /> 
Try to increment / decrement the counter, navigate to another menu-item, then return here to verify the counter / state is kept 
<br /><br /> 
Note: The state will be lost / back to initial 0 if you refresh by the browser
<br /><br />

<button (click)="increment()"> + </button>
    {{ count | async }}
<button (click)="decrement()"> - </button>
